> orthogene is an R package for easy mapping of orthologous genes across hundreds of species. It pulls up-to-date gene ortholog mappings across 700+ organisms. It also provides various utility functions to aggregate/expand common objects (e.g. data.frames, gene expression matrices, lists) using 1:1, many:1, 1:many or many:many gene mappings, both within- and between-species.

> For most functions, orthogene lets users choose between different methods, each with complementary strengths and weaknesses: "gprofiler", "homologene", and "babelgene"
